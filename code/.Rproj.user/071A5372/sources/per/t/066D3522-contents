Since, Five days corresponds to one week of trading days, 10 days corresponds to two weeks of trading days, and 20 days corresponds to approximately one month of
trading days we have removed Saturday and Sunday where most trades does not happen.

Relative Strength Index Indicator <- It is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to analyze overbought or oversold conditions.

Readings below 30 generally indicate that the stock is oversold, while readings above 70 indicate that it is overbought.Generally, 14 days are use as default for computation purposes.

```{r}
for_date <- function(x){
  return(as.Date(as.POSIXct(strptime(x,"%d/%m/%Y"))))
}
```
```{r}
mod_date= lapply(btc[2:1796,1],for_date)
```

```{r}
btc.xts <- xts(btc[1:1795,2:8],order.by=mod_date$Date)

```


```{r}
btc.xts <- subset(btc.xts, btc.xts$Weekday!=6 & btc.xts$Weekday!=7)

#man.xts <- subset(btc.xts$Adjusted, man.xts$Weekday!=6 & btc.xts$Weekday!=7)

#n.xts <- man.xts[,2]
```

```{r}
btc <- subset(btc, btc$Weekday!=6 & btc$Weekday!=7)
eth <- subset(eth, eth$Day!="Sat" & eth$Day!="Sun")
```


```{r}
rsi <- RSI(Cl(btc.xts),n=14)
barChart(btc.xts,theme=chartTheme("white"))
addRSI(n=14)
```
stochastic oscillator <- The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that relates the location of each day's close relative to the high/low range over the past 14 days.

nFastK <- number of past periods to use(14 is chosen)
nFastD <- number smoothing periods to apply to fastK.
nSlowD <-  the number smoothing periods to apply to fastD.

```{r}
stochOSC <-stoch(btc.xts[,c("High","Low","Close")],nFastK = 14,
  nFastD = 3,
  nSlowD = 3,)
StoFASTK = stochOSC$fastK
StoFASTD = stochOSC$fastD
StoSLOWK = stochOSC$slowD
tail(stochOSC,10)
```

```{r}

plot(tail(stochOSC[,"fastK"], 100), type="l",
    main="Fast %K ", ylab="")
```
The average directional index (ADX) is used to determine when the price is trending strongly.Some people only use this indicator to initiate Buy or Sell.

If AdX values is in range of:

0-25	Absent or Weak Trend
25-50	Strong Trend
50-75	Very Strong Trend
75-100	Extremely Strong Trend
```{r}
adx <- ADX(btc.xts[,c("High","Low","Close")])$ADX
tail(adx,10)

```
```{r}
plot(tail(adx, 100), type="l",
    main="Average Directional Index ", ylab="")
```

Price rate of change is calculated by subtracting the old value from the current value of the variable and dividing it by the old value. It is expressed as a percentage.

```{r}
roc <- ROC(btc.xts[,"Close"])
tail(roc,n=3)
```
On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical indicator of momentum, using volume changes to make price predictions.

```{r}
obv <- OBV(btc.xts[,"Close"], btc.xts[,"Volume"])
tail(obv,n=3)
```

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical oscillator that uses price and volume data for identifying overbought or oversold signals in an asset
```{r}
mfi <- MFI(btc.xts[,"Close"], btc.xts[,"Volume"], n =14)
tail(mfi,n=3)
```
The Williams Accumulation / Distribution (AD) line is a measure of market momentum.


Distribution of the security is indicated when the security is making a new high and the A/D indicator is failing to make a new high. Sell.

Accumulation of the security is indicated when the security is making a new low and the A/D indicator is failing to make a new low. Buy.

```{r}
ad <- williamsAD(btc.xts[,c("High","Low","Close")])
tail(ad,n=3)
```
Moving averages are used by investors and traders to track and identify trends by smoothing normal day-to-day price fluctuations.

For example 20 day Moving average calculates average price of BTC over past 20 days which can be used for support, resistance level indicator.
```{r}
MA50 <-SMA(Cl(btc.xts),n=50)
MA200 <-SMA(Cl(btc.xts),n=200)
tail(MA50,n=3)
tail(MA200,n=3)

```

The MACD(moving average convergence/divergence) line is calculated by subtracting the 14-period EMA from the 3-period EMA. 

An EMA is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.

```{r}
macd <- MACD(Cl(btc.xts), nFast=14, nSlow=3,
             nSig=9, percent=FALSE)
MACD <- macd$macd
MACDSignal <- macd$signal
tail(macd,n=5)
```

```{r}
plot(tail(MACD, 100), type="l",
    main="MACD AND MOVING AVGS.", ylab="")
lines(MACDSignal, lwd=2, col=2)
lines(MA50, lwd=2, col=3)
lines(MA200, lwd=2, col=4)
```
Macro-Economic Variables:

Economic policy uncertainty(EPU) is measured using the US economic
policy uncertainty index and economic market uncertainty is measured using the economic market uncertainty index(EMU). 
```{r}
EPU <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/EPU.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
EMU <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/EMU.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
```

We get  values of 5 working days in week
```{r}
EPU <- subset(EPU, EPU$Day!="Sat" & EPU$Day!="Sun")$USEPUINDXD
EMU <- subset(EMU, EMU$Day!="Sat" & EMU$Day!="Sun")$WLEMUINDXD
```
Check null and na values if wxist in EPU and EMU    
```{r}
is.null(EPU)
is.null(EMU)
sum(is.na(EPU))
sum(is.na(EMU))
```

Interest rates are measured using the yield on the US ten-year bond (Tenyrbond), three-month T-bill (ThreemTbill), and the spread (spread) between these variables.
```{r}
Tenyrbond <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/Tenyrbond.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)$THREEFY10
ThreemTbill <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/ThreemTbill.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)$DTB3
```
In this dataset the Sat and Sun are already removed therefore check of na and null values need to be done.

```{r}
is.null(Tenyrbond)
is.null(ThreemTbill)
sum(is.na(Tenyrbond))
sum(is.na(ThreemTbill))
```

We can see there are coloumns which contains just "." instead of null or na so we need to replace 
```{r}
Tenyrbond['.' == Tenyrbond] = round(mean(as.numeric(Tenyrbond[-which('.' == Tenyrbond)])),4)
ThreemTbill['.' == ThreemTbill] = round(mean(as.numeric(ThreemTbill[-which('.' == ThreemTbill)])),4)
```


Equity and oil market uncertainty is measured using the VIX and the OVX respectively. The VIX is the CBOE volatility index that represents the US stock market expectations of volatility for the next 30 days. OVX is an estimate of the expected volatility over the next thirty days of the US crude oil prices.

```{r}
OVX <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/OVX.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)$OVX
VIX <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/VIX.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)$VIXCLS
```
In this dataset the Sat and Sun are already removed therefore check of na and null values need to be done.

```{r}
is.null(OVX)
is.null(VIX)
sum(is.na(OVX))
sum(is.na(VIX))
```

We can see there are columns which contains just "." instead of null or na so we need to replace with mean. 
```{r}
OVX['.' == OVX] = round(mean(as.numeric(OVX[-which('.' == OVX)])),2)
VIX['.' == VIX] = round(mean(as.numeric(VIX[-which('.' == VIX)])),2)
```


Variables are included for expected five-year inflation (Fiveyrinfexp) and break-even inflation (be_inflation). The equity market volatility infectious disease tracker (EMV_IDT) is included to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

```{r}
Fiveyrinfexp <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/Fiveyrinfexp.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
dat=Fiveyrinfexp$Date
Fiveyrinfexp <- Fiveyrinfexp$T5YIE
be_inflation <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/be_inflation.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)$T10YIE
EMV_IDT <- read_csv("C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/EMV_IDT.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
```
In the Fiveyrinfexp & be_inflation datasets the Sat and Sun are already removed therefore check of na and null values need to be done but for EMV_IDT has sat and sumday therefore the subset must be considered for that dataset.

```{r}
EMV_IDT <- subset(EMV_IDT, EMV_IDT$Day!="Sat" & EMV_IDT$Day!="Sun")$INFECTDISEMVTRACKD
is.null(Fiveyrinfexp)
is.null(be_inflation)
is.null(EMV_IDT)
sum(is.na(Fiveyrinfexp))
sum(is.na(be_inflation))
sum(is.na(EMV_IDT)) 
```
```{r}
which(is.na(EMV_IDT))

EMV_IDT[is.na(EMV_IDT)] <- mean(EMV_IDT, na.rm = TRUE)


```
```{r}

```

We can see there are columns which contains just "." instead of null or na so we need to replace with mean. and col 1263 in EMV_IDT also has same "." in place of number so we just need to replace it by the mean of the column.  
```{r}
Fiveyrinfexp['.' == Fiveyrinfexp] = round(mean(as.numeric(Fiveyrinfexp[-which('.' == Fiveyrinfexp)])),2)

be_inflation['.' == be_inflation] = round(mean(as.numeric(be_inflation[-which('.' == be_inflation)])),2)

```


```{r}
final_df = data.frame(dat,btc.xts$Open,btc.xts$High,btc.xts$Low,btc.xts$Close,btc.xts$Adjusted,btc.xts$Volume,rsi,StoFASTK,StoFASTD,StoSLOWK,adx,roc,obv,mfi,ad,MA50,MA200,MACD,MACDSignal,EPU,EMU,Tenyrbond,ThreemTbill,OVX,VIX,Fiveyrinfexp,be_inflation,EMV_IDT)

```
```{r}
#Execute below code if you want to save final df as csv file.
#write.csv(final_df,"C://Users/manoj/Desktop/BEFD_Project_Images/Final_df.csv")
```

Since our final dataframe has lot of NA values we drop for first 50 days of data so now we have data from 07/02/2018(50th point) - 30/10/2022(1282 point)

We also drop MA200 column has 200 NA values in it so i decided to drop thr column


```{r}
new_df <- final_df[50:1282,-c(18)]

#new_df <- cbind(row_names = row.names(new_df), new_df)

rownames(new_df) <- c(1:1233)

colnames(new_df)[1] <- "Date"

# Convert Tenyrbond,ThreemTbill,OVX,VIX, Fiveyrinfexp,be_inflation from char to numeric

new_df$Tenyrbond <- as.numeric(new_df$Tenyrbond)
new_df$ThreemTbill <- as.numeric(new_df$ThreemTbill)
new_df$OVX <- as.numeric(new_df$OVX)
new_df$VIX <- as.numeric(new_df$VIX)
new_df$Fiveyrinfexp <- as.numeric(new_df$Fiveyrinfexp)
new_df$be_inflation  <- as.numeric(new_df$be_inflation )

head(new_df)
```
```{r}
#Check which column has NA values in the dataframe

# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Count the number of missing values in each column
missing_counts <- colSums(is.na(new_df))

# Print the number of missing values in each column
print(missing_counts)

``` 
```{r}
new_df <- na.omit(new_df)
```


Before starting feature selection there are columns which need to dropped because if high correlation they are Open,High,Low,Close and Volume since we donot knoe these to known us on day of prediction.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
new_df1 = select(new_df, -c(2,3,4,5,7,'ad'))

col_names <- names(new_df1)
col_names[2] <- "Price"
col_names[3] <- "RSI"
col_names[9] <- "OBV"
col_names[11] <- "MA_50"
col_names[13] <- "MACDSignal"
names(new_df1) <- col_names

#new_df1$index <- as.numeric(row.names(new_df1))
#new_df1[order(new_df1$index),]
```
Let's do feature selection using xgboost
```{r}
library(gbm)

boost.model=gbm(Price ~ . ,data=new_df1[,2:22], 
                 distribution="gaussian",n.trees=5000, interaction.depth=8, shrinkage=0.01)

# default vector of parameters
mai.old<-par()$mai
mai.old
#new vector
mai.new<-mai.old
#new space on the left
mai.new[2] <- 2.5 
mai.new
#modify graphical parameters
par(mai=mai.new)

#relative influence plot
summary(boost.model, las=1, cBar=10) 
#cBar defines how many variables
#back to orginal window
par(mai=mai.old)
```
Therefore the modt important WAD (Williams' Accumulation/Distribution), obv(On-balance volume), SMA(50-day moving average), Tenyrbond (Yield on the US ten-year
bond (used for calculating interest rates)),ThreemTbill (three-month T-bill), signal ((MACD Signal) moving average cross-over divergence), OVX(estimate of the expected
volatility over the next thirty days of the US crude oil prices), MFI (Money Flow Index ), be_inflation (break-even inflation), RSI(Relative Strength Index)



Dataset after Top-10 features selected based on importance using Gradient Boosting Models


```{r}
final_df = new_df1[,c('Date','Price','MA_50','OBV','ThreemTbill','RSI','Tenyrbond','MACDSignal','mfi','macd','be_inflation','OVX')]

ARIMA Modeling

```{r}

```

```{r}

# Convert the data to a time series object
ts_data_train <- ts(final_df$Price[2:1222], frequency = 5)
ts_data_test <- ts(final_df$Price[1222:1232], frequency = 5)

# Decompose the time series using the stl function
stl_decomposition <- stl(ts_data_train, s.window = "periodic")

# Extract the seasonality, trend, and remainder components
seasonality <- stl_decomposition$time.series[, 1]
trend <- stl_decomposition$time.series[, 2]

```

```{r}
#pice <- btc.xts$Adjusted

model = auto.arima(ts_data_train)

res <- residuals(model)
Acf(res)
```
Here, ACF plot shows significant autocorrelation at long lag periods, it could indicate that the model is not a good fit for the data and there may be patterns in the residuals that are not being captured by the model. This could suggest that a different model or a different method of fitting the model to the data may be needed

```{r}

A we see median lies at 10576 and 3rd quartile from the median is much larger than the 1st quartile from the median in a box plot, it could indicate that the data is skewed to the right.

```{r}
boxplot(final_df$Price,col = rgb(0.75, 1, 0.79),main="BTC", ylab="Price")
```
From histogram we can get to know that data is not only right skewed but is right skewed exponentially

The high deviation value indicates that the model is not able to accurately predict the observed values, and the high AIC value indicates that the model is not a good fit to the data


CART(Classification and Regression Trees)

```{r}
library(tree)

dev.tree <- sum((p.tree-final_df.test$Price)^2)
err = mean((final_df.test$Price - p.tree)^2)
dev.tree
err
```
For data with preprocessing model fit is relatively poor for CART 

After standard scaling of the data are relatively noise-free and the model is expected to make highly accurate predictions, then a higher deviation value (e.g., 4.605) might be considered poor performance.

Residuals clearly show a nonlinear behaviour there fore we need to use non-linear models.

We can see from ACF there are many significant auto-correlations between residuals.

Let's see what happened on January 8th,2021 which lead to rise of btc suddenly?

From August 2020 to February 2021 ther is second wave of Covid-19 due to which many has invested their money in notable precious metals like Gold and Bitcoin to during the uncertain times. Which lead to drastc rise of bitcoin.

lines(year, (ucrcdNR$fitted.i[[2]]), lwd=2, col=2)


###we also add a line and some text within the plot
abline(v=272, lty=2)
#text(50, 0.8, pos=1, "Money withdrawn from BTC is invested in ETH incresed price of it ")

```
Here, the rivalry is advantageous for ETH due to BTC, which increased the market potential in such a way that the normalized ETH had faster growth than BTC at a specific point in time.
